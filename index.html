      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a recent college graduate looking to advance my career.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from the south suburbs of Chicago.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I can watch Netflix all day long. I love to just sit there and get invested in a t.v show and forget about anything else.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to eventually open up my own digital marketing agency. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Tinley Park, Illinois.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Other than the fact that I find it to be so interesting to learn how to make all these advanced websites and apps, I really want to be able to leverage the knowledge I learn here to help me eventually build my own business with what I know. As mentioned above, I want to have my own digital marketing agency so I would love to be able to also help them build their websites. </p>
